// explicity the following paragraph
//    The UNIX™ conformance variants use the $UNIX2003 suffix.
//
//    Important: The work for UNIX™ conformance started in Mac OS 10.4, but was not completed until 10.5. Thus, in the 10.4 versions of libSystem.dylib, many of the conforming variant symbols (with the $UNIX2003 suffix) exist. The list is not complete, and the conforming behavior of the variant symbols may not be complete, so they should be avoided.
//
//    Because the 64-bit environment has no legacy to maintain, it was created to be UNIX™ conforming from the start, without the use of the $UNIX2003 suffix. So, for example, _fputs$UNIX2003 in 32-bit and _fputs in 64-bit will have the same conforming behavior.

// This file provides a workaround for an error that sometimes occurs when enabling code coverage
// metrics on iOS using LLVM/Clang and libprofile_rt.dylib:
//
//   Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:
//   fopen$UNIX2003 called from function llvm_gcda_start_file in image ...
//
// To fix this problem simply include this file in your testing target build.
